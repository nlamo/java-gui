# java-gui

Basic Java MVC application that I'm using to connect to a MySQL database.

The user has the option to input their name, height, weight, and programming language preference. 

The 'Submit' button can be used to add all of these properties to a local database.

TODO:

- Start working on a user login screen
- Add an interface that will display certain text outputs based on queries
